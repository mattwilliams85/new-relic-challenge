## New Relic Coding Challenge

##### Assignment
The goal of this exercise is to assess your ability to write Semantic HTML and CSS. Along with
this document you will have received a Sketch file, the Gotham Narrow font bundle, and a PDF
version with the Subscription Upgrade Workflow in New Relicâ€™s Self-Service store. Below you
will find the supporting User Story describing how our customers can upgrade their
subscriptions to the New Relic product suite.
<br><br>
Assignment: Implement the Semantic HTML and CSS code for APM Step 4 Error page1 in the
Subscription Upgrade Workflow . You are not allowed to use a third party CSS framework, but
incrementally build your own as you implement the different areas in the APM Step 4 Error
page . Please feel free to make up the prices for each pricing model/level for the sake of this
exercise.
<br><br>
Think about the audience of your framework and coding exercise. How would you preserve
code readability, modularity, and maintainability? How would you set meaningful naming
conventions and organize your CSS? You are not expected to write a full-fledged framework,
just the parts that will support your implementation for the APM Step 4 Error page.
